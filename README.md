# EmployeeTimeSheet

This is my Employee Time Sheet Project. 

I had fun working on this project! I have rarely worked on .Net Web applications in the past several years, so it was a good refresher course for me. 

I unapologetically leaned on online help with this project, as being a good software engineer is more about persistence and knowing where to find good help than knowing everything off the top of your head! The results are simple but effective!

The Views were the hardest part, as one might expect since I was a little rusty on this side of things. 
I look forward to seeing more elegant strategies in existing PACS code for using the correct Modal bootstrap classes. 
I suspect this may have been the cause of some the struggles I had with the modal window not opening, not displaying validation errors, 
and leaving the main screen hanging when closing the modal window when either 1) the submission had failed validation, or 2) the data had successfully submitted.
