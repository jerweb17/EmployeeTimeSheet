# EmployeeTimeSheet

This is my Employee Time Sheet Project. 

I had fun working on this project! I have rarely worked on .Net Web applications in the past several years, so it was a good refresher course for me. 

I unapologetically leaned on online help with this project, as being a good software engineer is more about persistence and knowing where to find good help than knowing everything off the top of your head! The results are simple but effective!
